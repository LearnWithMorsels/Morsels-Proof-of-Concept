He did not always pick the best teams after leaving Ferrari after 77.</p><p>Schumacher, Prost, Vettel always drove in first rate winning cars, Lauda did not.</p>"

In a nutshell: Give him the second best package on the grid and he'll win you the championship.</p>"

But consider that the era these racers were in can not really be fairly compared to other eras with such different equipment, rules, etc. To me anyone of them that were top runners is the best in their era.</p><p>There are so many good pilots, but Fangio is simply the best. When you read about what he did, you understand no one else can do that. And the most important he was a gentleman.</p>"

Still in his fourties could come back to have some fun and have decent races, which is pretty spectacular demonstration of his talent and consistency. Especially when you think that many other drivers in their later 30s are called \"non-prime anymore\".</p>"
